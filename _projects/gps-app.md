overview: An animated single page site, outlining the the several core features of
  the Waze GPS app as well as information on Waze the business.
goal: To use animation to present product features to the user in the same manner
  as they would gather road information when actually using the app.

  Animations are triggered on scroll using Greensock / Scrollmagic, and movements
  are along a bezier curve.
