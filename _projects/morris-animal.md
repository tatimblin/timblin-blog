title: Morris Animal Refuge
type: eCommerce
url: https://tatimblin.github.io/morris-jekyll/
overview: A Philadelphia animal shelter was looking to increase donations and help
  take in more animals. We built them two web stores to start selling their own merch
  from day one.
goal: Build an online store easy enough to maintain, that shelter volunteers still
  get to focus on caring for the animals directly.
specific: We built out two identical versions of the store, one on Cafepress so they
  could easily start selling immediately (with zero upfront inventory costs), the
  other as a Jekyll site to serve as a template for when the store scales up and orders
  are processed in-house.
live: Support the shelter today (or just look at the design)
