overview: An interactive promotional site for the artists performing at the 2017 Lollapalooza
  festival in Chicago.
goal: Make a source for easy access to artist samples, letting viewers quickly be
  introduced to the +160 artists performing that weekend. Keeping the established
  and lively feel of the Lollapalooza brand, through various dynamic animation.
specific: Using a mix of CSS and JS animations, nearly everything on the site has
  some movement. A crowd of cheering fans dances to the music acting as a visualizer,
  other animation is either custom or run through skrollr or anime-js.
live: See (listen) for yourself
